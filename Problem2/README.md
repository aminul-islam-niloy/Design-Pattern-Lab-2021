## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).




Problem: 2
Suppose we want to withdraw cash from our bank account using check. Bank has the following business rule for cash withdrawal based on the amount written on check.
d) For Tk. 10,000 only cashier's authorization is sufficient to withdraw money from account.
e) For Tk. 10,000 to 10,00,000 authorization from both cashier and senior officer is needed
f) For Tk 10,00,000 authorization from Senior officer and Manager is mandatory.
Implement this business rule using Chain of Responsibility design pattern.

Special instructions for both problems
All your class/method/variable name should follow proper naming convention.
(ie. Class names should be TitleCased, method and variable name should be camelCased, and constants (if any) should be UPPERCASED, etc.)
Use meaningful name for all your classes, methods and variables that reflect their purpose.
Your code MUST be indented properly before submit.
