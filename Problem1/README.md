## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).



Problem: 1
Write a program to create various shapes like (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle)and calculate the area of the shape. You should use Factory Pattern for shape creation so that all shapes can be created using a single factory object.
Each shape should have their defining properties (For example circle should have radius, triangle should have length of its three side etc.) and a method named getArea() to calculate the area of the shape.
When creating a particular shape, you should initialize the shapes property with any default values (ie. for circle, radius = 1; for rectangle width = 2 and height = 1.5 etc.)


All your class/method/variable name should follow proper naming convention.
(ie. Class names should be TitleCased, method and variable name should be camelCased, and constants (if any) should be UPPERCASED, etc.)
Use meaningful name for all your classes, methods and variables that reflect their purpose.
Your code MUST be indented properly before submit.
