``Problem: 1``
Write a program to create various shapes like (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle)and calculate the area of the shape. You should use Factory Pattern for shape creation so that all shapes can be created using a single factory object.
Each shape should have their defining properties (For example circle should have radius, triangle should have length of its three side etc.) and a method named getArea() to calculate the area of the shape.
When creating a particular shape, you should initialize the shapes property with any default values (ie. for circle, radius = 1; for rectangle width = 2 and height = 1.5 etc.)

``Problem: 2``
Suppose we want to withdraw cash from our bank account using check. Bank has the following business rule for cash withdrawal based on the amount written on check.
d) For Tk. 10,000 only cashier's authorization is sufficient to withdraw money from account.
e) For Tk. 10,000 to 10,00,000 authorization from both cashier and senior officer is needed
f) For Tk 10,00,000 authorization from Senior officer and Manager is mandatory.
Implement this business rule using Chain of Responsibility design pattern.

``Special instructions for both problems``
All your class/method/variable name should follow proper naming convention.
(ie. Class names should be TitleCased, method and variable name should be camelCased, and constants (if any) should be UPPERCASED, etc.)
Use meaningful name for all your classes, methods and variables that reflect their purpose.
Your code MUST be indented properly before submit.
